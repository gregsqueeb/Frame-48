# Frame 48
 A handwired keyboard build inspired by the Void Ergo S! Runs QMK firmware and fully customizable with VIA configurator.

The Frame 48 is a 3d printed, handwired, split keyboard that was inspired by the [VOID ergo S](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo), running QMK Firmware on [Adafruit KB2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) controllers. Connection between the two halves of the keyboard is made with an aux cable via serial.

I suggest printing the case using a 0.4 mm nozzle, supports are not needed.

The brass inserts can be fixed in the bottom case by heating them and applying pressure with a soldering iron set to about 200-220C.

I created this iteration of the VOID Ergo S because I wanted my keyboard to have arrow keys as I use them a lot in my work as a product designer. I also wanted to build a keyboard that utilized [WorkLouder](https://worklouder.cc/) keycaps because I am a huge fan of their design and product. To be able to use their keycaps I needed to use choc style low profile switches which I couldn't get to work with the original Void Ergo S.

# QMK Files
I have included the raw [QMK files](</QMK Files>) to compile the firmware in addition to the [copiled firmware](</Compiled Firmware>) for the keyboard to make it easier for people who don't want to compile their own firmware.

# [VIA Configurator Layout](https://usevia.app/)
I have created a VIA Configurator design for the board as well so it is easier to see what you are editing. You can upload the JSON file in [this folder](</VIA Files>) to the [Design tab](https://usevia.app/#/design) of VIA Configurator

# ðŸ’– Inspiration and Thanks ðŸ’–
Huge shout out to [Victor Luchachi](https://victorlucachi.ro/) who makes absolutely beautiful products and renders. The design language of this build is based off of his Void Ergo S keyboard and his VOID 16 build was my very first keyboard build.

Thank you so much to [Joe Scotto](https://www.youtube.com/joescotto) for his awesome videos on handwiring keyboards. His pictures on reddit inspired me to use copper wiring on my build which ended up making the wiring process much easier and looks much much cleaner.

A massive fanboy shoutout to [WorkLouder](https://worklouder.cc/) for creating an absolutely beautiful and high quality product. The design of your keyboards and keycaps are amazing!
