# Void Ergo 65
 A handwired keyboard build inspired by the Void Ergo S! Runs QMK firmware and fully customizable with VIA configurator.

The VOID Ergo 65 is a 3d printed, handwired, split keyboard that was inspired by the [VOID ergo S](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo), running QMK Firmware on [Adafruit KB2040](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) controllers. Connection between the two halves of the keyboard is made with an aux cable via serial.

I suggest printing the case using a 0.4 mm nozzle, supports are not needed.

The brass inserts can be fixed in the bottom case by heating them and applying pressure with a soldering iron set to about 200-220C.

I created this iteration of the VOID Ergo S because I wanted my keyboard to have arrow keys as I use them a lot in my work as a product designer. I also wanted to build a keyboard that utilized [WorkLouder](https://worklouder.cc/) keycaps because I am a huge fan of their design and product. To be able to use their keycaps I needed to use choc style low profile switches which I couldn't get to work with the original Void Ergo S.

# QMK Files
I have included the raw [QMK files](</QMK Files>) to compile the firmware in addition to the [copiled firmware](</Compiled Firmware>) for the keyboard to make it easier for people who don't want to compile their own firmware.

# [VIA Configurator Layout](https://usevia.app/)
I have created a VIA Configurator design for the board as well so it is easier to see what you are editing. You can upload the JSON file in [this folder](</VIA Files>) to the [Design tab](https://usevia.app/#/design) of VIA Configurator
